<h1>Software Engineering </h1> 
<h3>Programming Language: JavaScript</h3>
 
<p>Very often we confuse ourselves with JavaScript and Java. However, both are programming languages but quit independent from each other. However, it is an interpreted language, but uses a blend of compiler to be able to get the best performance. Every code has to be interpreted by the machine and compiled for human understanding.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a very powerful but light weight front-end development language for web applications. Looking at the history of JavaScript, it was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed to JavaScript to cash on the popularity of Sun Microsystem’s Java language which was taken over by the Oracle Plc.</p>
<p>JavaScript is sometimes confused with ECMAScript which is an International Europeans Computer Manufacturing Association known for setting standards for the Information Technology Industry. The ECMAScript merely refers to the organisation’s approval of the JavaScript. Since that edition, there has been many revisions and editions of the Script and are published annually. The most and current ones are the 2019 – ECMAScript 2019 (ES2019) and ECMAScript 2020(ES2020), which is the 11th edition and released in June 2020.</p>
<p>As JavaScript is integral part of web development and applications, all browsers and web editors are embedded with JavaScript engine. You can read, write, code and run on any editor and web browsers such as Firefox, Goggle Chrome, Internet Explorer and the host of them without the need for installing and configuring the JavaScript engine.</p>
<p>JavaScript is as popular as the World Wide Web because it is used in almost all the websites and apps all over the world. The first point of contact of the world wide web is the HTML and followed the CSS and thirdly the JavaScript. It is a dynamic language and used by creative organisations for movies, games, animations, images and other interactive applications such as emails, live chats and other applications.</p>
JavaScript engineers are sought all over the world and there is no limited to what you can do with JavaScript with a creative mind.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>JavaScript is a client side programming language. In other words, it is a Web scripting language in that it is run and processed on the browser.</p>
<p>JavaScript is easy to learn and understand because it is a loosely typed language.</p>
<p>It is a loosely typed language in that you do not really have to define your variables and data type. It will be interpret and converted where appropriate and processed.</p>

<h4>Choice of IDE (Integrated Development Environment)   </h4>
	You can run JavaScript on any IDE.  You can also code and run JavaScript on the browser.
<h4> Download and Installation </h4>
I am to use Atom.  It is an open Source IDE and does not cost to install. For Windows and Mac-OS, it is easy to download and install even for Linux.
